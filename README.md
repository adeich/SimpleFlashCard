SimpleFlashCard
===============

Originally meant to be a commandline flashcard program, this is now just a set of python programs I've written for the purpose of bulk-downloading of word definitions and maintaining json and csv files. I upload the csv file to StudyBlue, which is an adequate flashcard app with a nice interface.
